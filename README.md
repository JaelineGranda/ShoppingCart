Shopping Cart:

-An MVC application that uses a session object to store and retrieve selected items from different categories by the user
-When the user selects some items and presses the "Add to Cart" button, the servlet will add the selected items to the session object and then retrieve all of the items currently in the session object and then display them in the browser
-Removing an item from the shopping cart occurs in the same servlet
-URL-rewriting and hidden fields are both used

Technologies used:
